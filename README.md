	Allows Bonelab's in-game mod.io downloader to mount pre patch 4 mods.

## Why?
So that you don't have to manually download your avatars and levels.
All it does is make it ignore the pallet version, and rename pallet.json to (barcode).pallet.json after it extracts the addon.

## Disclaimer
I haven't thoroughly tested it yet. (I only tested it with a few avatars, two weapon packs and a level)\
However, don't be surprised if your game crashes or glitches. A lot has changed in patch 4.\
The main purpose of the mod is to be able to download avatars and simple stuff.
