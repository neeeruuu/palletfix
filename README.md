	Allows Bonelab's in-game mod.io downloader to mount pre patch 4 mods.
</p>

## What does it do?
It prevents downloads from failing when attempting to download a mod that was released before patch 4.
All it does is make it ignore the pallet version, and rename pallet.json to (barcode).pallet.json after it extracts the addon.

## Why?
So that you don't have to manually download your avatars and levels.

## Installation
Grab the latest build from [here](https://github.com/neeeruuu/palletfix/releases/latest), and extract it to your game's main folder. (steamapps/common/BONELAB)

## Disclaimer
I haven't thoroughly tested it yet. (I only tested it with a few avatars, tone weapon pack, which ofc didn't work, and a bunch of levels)\
However, don't be surprised if your game crashes or glitches. A lot has changed in patch 4.\
The main purpose of the mod is to be able to download avatars and simple stuff.
